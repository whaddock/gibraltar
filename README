This is a library for Reed-Solomon coding that is designed to be used
with an NVIDIA GPU, preferably with compute capability 1.3 or later.
It includes two sample programs found in the examples directory.

To build a unified version, simply issue "make". This will build a
version that includes functionality for all three backends: CUDA,
Jerasure, and a slow CPU reference. Your CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS should
have the compiler directives necessary to find your CUDA include files
and library files, respectively.

Ensure that, when running Gibraltar applications, nvcc is available
at /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc.

Optionally, if more than one CUDA GPU exists on the system, use
"GIB_GPU_ID" to tell it which to use.  Use a number between 0 and
MAX-1.

By default, a compute context 1.3 or greater GPU is assumed.  If this
is not the case, define GIB_USE_MMAP to be 0.

This version has been enhanced to work with the Ceph Erasure Coding Plugin 
interface. It also has an encryption feature that can perform GCM encryption 
and decryption.
